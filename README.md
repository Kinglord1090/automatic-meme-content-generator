# Automatic Meme Content Generator ðŸŽ­

This project is a Flask-based web application that automates the creation of memes using top Reddit posts. Users can log in, configure their preferences (like subreddit, duration, caption templates), and generate memes with audio, video, and image support. Ideal for content creators, social media managers, or anyone who wants to automate meme production with a customizable pipeline.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to manage individual meme generation sessions.
- **Reddit Integration**: Uses Reddit's API via `PRAW` to fetch top posts from user-selected subreddits.
- **Meme Workflow Configurator**: Set preferences for content type, template styles, captions, durations, and more.
- **Video + Audio Meme Generator**: Automatically generates memes in video format with synchronized audio.
- **Image Meme Creation**: For static meme generation with flexible captioning.
- **Review Dashboard**: Interface to view, manage, and edit generated meme content.
- **Extensible and Modular**: Easily adaptable for new features like watermarking, scheduling posts, or platform-specific exports.
